			I was born in Eskisehir in 2000. I lived there for 13 years 
			then moved to Kocaeli and started <a href= "https://www.kkfl41.com">Kocaeli Science 
			High School </a>there.4 years later I started <a href="http://www.cs.itu.edu.tr/en/homepage">
			ITU Computer Engineering </a> for my Bachelor Degree. I was enjoying my coding classes so
			much that I keep thinking about giving lessons about coding all the time but
			I didn’t have much time to teach otherwhile I was there.

			After graduation, I started my master Degree in <a href="https://www.uio.no/english/">
			University of Oslo</a>(robotics and intellegent systems). I started to work for <a href="https://firstengineers.no">
			First Engineers</a> as a software engineer. After two years I created a website
			that teaches how to code. I started to upload videos there and it got a lot 
			attention.

			After my career in First Engineers, I returned to my country and started 
			Caglar Coding Course in Ankara.First I tried to reach for kids from east 
			side of Turkey who may not be able to learn computer science, I gave them
			educational and financial support. Then I opened my second office in Istanbul
			for kids that wanted to learn coding and coputer science from Europe and 
			also west side of Turkey. In Istanbul office, lots of ITU computer 
			engineering students started to work for Caglar Coding and developed their 
			skils for both in terms of comunication and coding.

			As Caglar Coding spread, I opened offices in Algiers, Oslo and Bremen.
			Now, Caglar coding is one of the biggest programming course around the 
			world.
